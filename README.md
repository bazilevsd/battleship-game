# battleship-game

The project is a school exersise. We were given a project to create a game. Which game, it was up to us to choose. Battleship is one of my most favorite games, so I decided to create it in my project.

The game is complete as of now but could have multiple additional perks, so I can always continue working on it.

Game is involving two players. First page describes how the game is played, next slide asks for player's one name. Next - for Player's 2 name. Next - player 1 sets ships, then plyer 2 sets ships. Then the game begins. Each ship occupies only one square in this version. Player 1 always attacks first. if opponent's ship is hit the cell turns red. Both grids appear at all time, but the opponent's ships are invisible on the player's attack mode. Wins player that sinks all 5 ships of opponent.

Code is built in Vanilla JS using classes, DOM, event listeners and functions.

I looked at W3Scool documentations and lots of examples on StackOverflow. Used PNGTREE for clip art and pictures from online sources for background.

the buttons came from this site (very useful)- https://getcssscan.com/css-buttons-examples

My code is very precise. I played the game to see all issues could come up in a different situatins and addressed them all in my code.

Special thanks to our teachers (Dominic Cobb, Marlin Makori, Steven Ballerini) for help and guidance.
